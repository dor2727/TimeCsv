from the format of a data file
into parsing of a line
then parsing of a file (reevaluate)
then we got a data list
	note: list & not generator since about 6k objects

choosing data - filters
returning list of bool
regular filters - e.g. description, group
	time filters - self.selected_time
	it is here because sometimes the filtered_data will have less time then the requested time, so we want to keep track of it
not filter
multiple filter

displaying data - statistics


displaying data - functions
current example - sleep
analysis of sleep patterns. it is not a general function, but the end-product. using filters & statistics to present graphs


user interaction - cli
argparse, trying to make every statistics class accessible

user interaction - telegram
generic commands - yesterday, today, last week, ..., reload
timed commands
cli command
